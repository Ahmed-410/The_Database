        The Thinker is a famous bronze sculpture by the French artist Auguste Rodin. It depicts a nude man sitting on a rock, resting his chin on his hand, in a pose of deep thought. The sculpture is often used as a symbol of philosophy or poetry.
        <br>
        The Thinker was originally part of a larger work called The Gates of Hell, which Rodin based on Dante's epic poem The Divine Comedy. The sculpture was meant to represent Dante himself, contemplating his poem at the entrance of Hell. However, Rodin later decided to make The Thinker an independent work, and gave it a more universal meaning. He also made several versions of the sculpture in different sizes and materials.
        <br>
        The Thinker is widely admired for its expressive and realistic style, as well as its powerful symbolism. It shows the human condition of being both physical and intellectual, and the struggle to find meaning in life. The sculpture also reflects Rodin's own artistic vision and personality, as he was known for his passion and creativity.
