        Man of Steel is the first Superman movie to come out after The Dark Knight era and turned out to be an absolute blockbuster. The movie was directed by Zack Snyder and contained all his signature styles of direction and casts Henry Cavill as Superman. This movie shows us the origin of Superman from the very beginning showing us a new take on the relationship Clark Kent had with his parents alongside facing a fierce enemy like General Zod.
