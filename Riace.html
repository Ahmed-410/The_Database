        The Riace Bronzes were discovered by accident in 1972, when an amateur scuba diver named Stefano Mariottini was out snorkeling off the shore of Riace in Calabria when he spotted what appeared to be a human arm sticking jotting out of the seabed. After contacting the police and concluding that the limb was not human, archeologists arrived on scene to uncover the famous bronze Greek statues. Based on their posture, the figures once held spears in their hands. Although it is uncertain exactly who created them, it has been suggested that they were created by different Greek sculptors, with Myron being a likely candidate for Statue A and Alcamenes being the possible sculptor of Statue B. Despite the time of their discovery, the statues were not exhibited until 1981 in Rome and Florence, where they drew crowds of over a million people in just a year.    </P>
