        The Scream is a famous painting by the Norwegian artist **Edvard Munch**.
        He created four versions of this composition between 1893 and 1910, using oil, tempera, pastel and crayon on cardboard.
        The painting shows a figure with an agonized expression on a bridge, with a blood-red sky and a blue-black fjord in the background.
        The painting is considered to be a symbol of the anxiety and alienation of modern life.
        Munch was inspired by a personal experience he had while walking with two friends at sunset. 
        He wrote in his diary that he felt a scream passing through nature and saw the clouds turning red.
        He also suffered from mental illness and had a fear of insanity, which may have influenced his expressionistic style.
        Some scholars have suggested that the red sky was caused by the volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in 1883,which tinted the sunsets for months.
        The Scream is one of the most iconic images of art history and has been reproduced, parodied and referenced in many media.
        It is also one of the most stolen artworks, having been taken twice from museums in Oslo, Norway.
        The most expensive version of The Scream was sold for $119.9 million at an auction in 2012, 
        making it one of the highest-priced paintings ever sold.
