        Also known as Nike of Samothrace, the Winged Victory of Samothrace is a celebrated marble sculpture from the Hellenistic period is a depiction of the Greek goddess of victory. It has been displayed at the Louvre Museum since 1884 and has been hailed as one of the greatest sculptures in the world. Created in the 2nd century BCE, this Hellenistic masterpiece is one of the very few examples of famous Greek statues that are not Roman copies, but the original sculpture itself. The right-wing of the statue, however, is not the original wing and was added later by mirroring the left-wing. The statue is 2.44 meters tall and is made from Thasian and Parian marble.
