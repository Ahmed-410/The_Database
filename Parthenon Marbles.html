        The Parthenon Frieze's east pediment depicted the birth of Athena from the head of Zeus, who was her father. The figures, which represented a part of the scene now lost, was Athena was moving away from Zeus as an armed and fully grown women. 
        The Parthenon Marbles statues are noted for their realistic depiction of human anatomy mixed with the representation of drapery in a complex yet harmonious manner. The figure on the left can be seen on the verge of standing up, with her right leg tucked in to help lever herself up. A figure to the right can be seen reclining in the lap of another figure. A few of the mythological beings have been identified as Aphrodite, Dione, and Hestia, who was the goddess of the home.
