        The Great Wave off Kanagawa. It's a super cool woodblock print by a Japanese artist named Katsushika Hokusai. 
        He made it in the early 1830s as part of a series of prints called Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. 
        The print shows three boats in a stormy sea, with a huge wave about to crash on them. 
        In the background, you can see Mount Fuji, which is a sacred mountain in Japan. Hokusai used a special blue pigment called Prussian blue, 
        which was imported from Europe, to create the vibrant color of the wave and the sky. He also used perspective and curves to make the wave look like it's spiraling and framing the mountain. 
        The print is super famous and has influenced many artists around the world, like Van Gogh, Monet and Debussy. You can find copies of it in many museums, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York or the British Museum in London. 
        It's probably one of the most iconic works of Japanese art ever!
