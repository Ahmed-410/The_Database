        Released in 2012, the final movie in Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy was The Dark Knight Rises. Originally, Heath Ledger was supposed to be playing the Joker once again in this movie but due to his untimely demise, the script was changed, and Bane, played by Tom Hardy, became the antagonist of the movie.
        We see Batman go toe to toe against an enemy who embraced the dark even more than Batman did. This movie shows Batman going on a journey of redemption and ultimately fully accepting his duty as the Guardian of Gotham City.
        This was the last movie where Bale appeared as Batman, marking an end to Nolans involvement in superhero movies. These movies were a fantastic run, which was loved by people all over the world. The only problem with Christopher Nolans Batman movies was the fact that he made these movies totally astray from the comic perspective of the character. Nolan made these       </P>
