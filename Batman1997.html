        Another Batman movie that was so bad that it became good was Batman and Robin released in 1997. In this movie, George Clooney was cast as Batman and if you look at him individually, he was not really a bad choice to play the lead role, but the way he had to play Batman made Batman and Robin one of the worst Batman movies ever made.
        Robin, played by Chris O Donnell, seems to be in constant competition with Batman resulting in corny dialogue and out-of-place humor. Arnold Schwarzenegger played the role of Mr. Freeze in this movie, and oh my god, the way it made me pull my hair. Mr. Freeze was seen constantly dropping unnecessary puns, jokes that were not funny, and whatnot.
        This is one of the worst Batman movies ever made, without a doubt, and for this reason, itâ€™s a must-watch for all Batman fans to know how much Batman has evolved throughout the years.
