        Lady of Auxerre, a female statuette in the Daedalic style. Limestone with incised decoration, formerly painted, ca. 640â€“630 BCE, made in Crete; Louvre Museum, CC BY 2.5, via Wikimedia Commons
        All that remains of this statue and other sculptures of its era is its limestone surface, as any paint that once decorated ancient Greek sculptures have been lost to time. Minoan influence can be seen in her narrow waist and an Egyptian influence can be seen in the rigid representation of her hair.
