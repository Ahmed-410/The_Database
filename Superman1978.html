        This was the first time Superman was seen on the big screen and even after his first-ever appearance, this movie set a standard for Superhero movies to come. The story was written by Mario Puzo while the director was Richard Donner. In this first Superman movie, we are also introduced to Lex Luthor played by Gene Hackman as well as the very first introduction of Krypton and the Villainous General Zod played by Terence Stamp.
