        The Three Musicians is a painting by Pablo Picasso, one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. He painted it in 1921, during his Synthetic Cubism period, which was characterized by the use of flat shapes, bright colors, and collage-like compositions. The painting shows three figures playing music in a room: a clarinetist, a guitarist, and a singer. They are dressed as characters from the commedia dell'arte, a type of Italian theater that Picasso was fond of. The clarinetist is Pierrot, a naive and melancholic clown; the guitarist is Harlequin, a cunning and mischievous trickster; and the singer is a monk, a religious figure. The painting is also a symbolic portrait of Picasso and his friends: the Harlequin represents Picasso himself, the Pierrot represents the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who died in 1918, and the monk represents the poet Max Jacob, who entered a monastery in 1921. The painting is a tribute to their friendship and their shared passion for art and music.

        The painting is one of two versions that Picasso made of the same subject. The other version is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Both paintings are very large, measuring more than 2 meters wide and high. They are considered masterpieces of Synthetic Cubism and examples of Picasso's creativity and innovation. The painting in the New York Museum of Modern Art was acquired by Alfred H. Barr Jr., the museum's first director, in 1936. It was one of the first major works by Picasso to enter an American museum collection
