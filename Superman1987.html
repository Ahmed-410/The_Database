        This movie was the final appearance of Christopher Reeves as Superman. It revolves around the time of the Cold War and Superman is making an attempt to convince human beings to get rid of their nuclear weapons. Supermanâ€™s arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor manages to escape from prison and creates an entity called Nuclear Man, played by Mark Pillow with his mission being the annihilation of Superman. This movie is considered to be the worst movie out of Christopher Reeves Superman movies and according to fans, this was not an appropriate farewell to the actor from his role.    </P>
