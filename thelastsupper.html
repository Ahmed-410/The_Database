        The Last Supper is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci,
         who was a genius artist and inventor from Italy.<br> He painted it between 1495 and 1498, 
         when he was working for Ludovico Sforza, the ruler of Milan. 
         Sforza asked him to decorate the wall of a dining hall in a monastery called Santa Maria delle Grazie. The painting shows the scene of the last supper of Jesus and his twelve disciples, as described in the Gospel of John. It's a very dramatic moment, because Jesus has just announced that one of them will betray him, and they are all shocked and wondering who it is. Leonardo used his skills of perspective, anatomy, light and shadow, and expression to create a realistic and emotional picture of the event. He also included some details that have sparked a lot of speculation and controversy over the centuries, such as the mysterious figure next to Jesus (is it John or Mary Magdalene?), the hidden hand holding a knife (who does it belong to?), and the number 13 (a symbol of bad luck?). Some people think that Leonardo hid some secret messages or codes in his painting, but others disagree, one of the most important arguments: some people agree that marry (the mother of Jesus) was painted in the picture while some people agree with that many others do no. The painting is very famous, but also very fragile, because Leonardo experimented with a new technique that didn't work very well. He used tempera paint on a dry wall, instead of fresco paint on a wet wall, which made the colors more vivid but also more prone to flaking and fading. The painting has suffered a lot of damage over time, from humidity, mold, vandalism, wars, and restoration attempts. The last restoration was done in 1999, and it tried to preserve   as much as possible of Leonardo's original work.
