        The second movie in Christopher Nolans Batman movies was The Dark Knight released in 2008. This is one of those movies that turned out to be a timeless classic for the awesome portrayal of Batman and an even more amazing portrayal of the Joker by Heath Ledger.
        After Batman 1989, this representation of the Joker was the best anyone has ever seen. This movie shows us Bruce Wayne who is in a conflict about himself and what he is doing. We see him grow emotionally, embrace this darker self he has created. The picturisation of this movie is brilliant and the way Joker is shown to us is truly terrifying. This movie is a must-watch for every Batman fan.
