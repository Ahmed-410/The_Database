        the full story behind Guernica by Picasso. He was a famous Spanish artist who painted this huge mural in 1937. 
        It's one of his best-known works and many people think it's the most powerful anti-war painting ever. 
        You can see it in a museum in Madrid, Spain.
        He painted it after he heard about the bombing of Guernica, a town in the Basque Country in northern Spain. 
        The Nazis and the Fascists bombed it for the Spanish Nationalists, who wanted to overthrow the Republican government. 
        The bombing killed hundreds of people and destroyed the town. It was a terrible act of violence and chaos.  
        Picasso wanted to show the suffering and horror of war in his painting. He used grey, black, and white colors to create a dark and gloomy mood. 
        He also used cubism and surrealism to make the shapes and figures look distorted and twisted. He painted a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames. 
        These symbols have different meanings for different people, but they all show pain and fear.
        Picasso showed his painting at the Paris World's Fair in 1937 to raise awareness and money for the Spanish Civil War. The war lasted from 1936 to 1939 and killed hundreds of thousands of people. Picasso's painting became famous and traveled around the world. It helped to bring attention to the war         </P>
