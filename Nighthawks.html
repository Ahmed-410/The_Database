        Nighthawks is a painting that shows four people in a diner at night, as seen from the outside. The diner is bright and cozy, while the street is dark and empty. The painting was made by Edward Hopper, 
        an American artist who liked to paint realistic scenes of urban life. He finished it in 1942, during World War II.
        Hopper said he got the idea for the painting from a restaurant he saw on Greenwich Avenue in New York. He also said he was not trying to show loneliness or isolation, 
        but just the mood of a big city at night. Some people think he was influenced by some short stories by Ernest Hemingway, who also wrote about lonely people in cafes and bars.       
        The painting is one of the most famous and recognizable works of American art. It's also one of the most popular paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it's been since 1942. 
        The painting has inspired many other artists, writers, filmmakers and musicians who have used it as a reference or a tribute.
