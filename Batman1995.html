        In 1995, Val Kilmer was cast as Batman for Batman Forever and I won’t be wrong to say that it turned out to be a hot mess. Val Kilmer, in himself, was not bad in the role of Batman but the way this movie was made took Batman back to the Adam West era. Jim Carrey was cast to play the role of the Riddler, and he overdid it in every possible way it was possible to overdo it.
        Of course, this movie is one of the classics but if you’re planning on watching this movie, prepare yourself for some unnecessary and forced humor with terrible direction and storytelling.
