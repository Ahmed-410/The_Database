    <P> 
        Superman 2 was a direct continuation of the first Superman movie with Christopher Reeve reprising the role of Superman this movie was initially directed by Richard Donner but was later removed as the director by the final leg of the movie being replaced by Richard Lester. This movie features General Zod once again along with Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. This movie was quite anticipated both by the audience as well as the team of the movie since its production began even before Superman(1978) was even released
