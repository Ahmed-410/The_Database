        Justice League was not exactly a Batman movie, but it is on this list because of its importance in the DC comicverses Batman. Justice League was initially released in 2017 but was terribly made because of the sudden changes in direction. This caused the fans to be enraged and demand to see the original movie as it was supposed to be under Zack Snyder.
        In 2021 Zack Snyders Justice League was released on HBO Max, and boy oh boy, it was an absolute masterpiece. From direction to picturization, the perfectly timed slow motions, the VFX everything was perfect. Every Batman fan should watch Zack Snyders Justice League because trust me guys, it doesnâ€™t get any better.
