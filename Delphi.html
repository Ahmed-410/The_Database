    <h1><br><br>The Charioteer of Delphi (c. 470 BCE)</h1>

        This bronze sculpture was found in the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi in 1896 and is one of the most well-preserved statues from the Delphi region. Also known as The Reign Holder, it is widely accepted that it was created to commemorate of the victory of Polyzalus at the Pythian Games. The Charioteer of Delphi was originally part of a group of sculpture but the others were moved and melted for resale. Luckily, this sculpture managed to escape after it was trapped under a rockfall. 
        It is unknown who made the sculptures for sure but it has been attributed to several Greek sculptors, including Pythagoras and Calamis. Despite its Sicilian theme, it is believed the sculpture was cast in Athens due to certain stylistic observations. Scholars pointed out several stylistic similarities with other statues from Athens such as the Piraeus Apollo (c. 530 BCE). 
        The bronze statue also attained its distinctive green tinge from its many years of exposure to a humid and enclosed space.
