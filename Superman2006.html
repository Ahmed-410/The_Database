        Superman Returns storyline follows up the second part of Christopher Reeves Superman. The story of Superman Returns takes up right after what happens in Superman 2 ignoring the other two Superman movies. Superman returns to Earth after a five-year-long trip to his home planet Krypton. When he returns a lot has changed, Lex Luthor has been released from prison and is plotting something serious against Superman. This movie was a box-office hit but was not really profitable since the total revenue generated by the movie was $400 million but the expense of making the movie was $200 million.
