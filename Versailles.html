                This sculpture is a Roman marble copy of the lost bronze original, which depicted the Greek goddess Artemis with a deer and was attributed to Leochares from around 325 BCE. Diana is a Roman goddess, who was portrayed in the middle of a hunting scene, drawing an arrow with which to pursue her prey. The sculpture was given to Henry II of France by Pope Paul IV in 1556. Although it is occasionally confused with the other Artemis statue, which is situated at the Temple of Ephesus, the Diana of Versailles is considered a masterpiece among other sculptures that were exported from Italy. The original bronze sculpture by Leochares was commonly known as Artemis with a Hind. Other replicas of the Greek original have been discovered in Algeria, Turkey, and Libya.
