        The Mona Lisa is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, who was a genius artist and inventor from Italy.<br>He painted it between 1503 and 1519, but he never gave it to the person who commissioned it. That person was Francesco del Giocondo, a rich silk merchant who wanted a portrait of his wife, Lisa. Her full name was Lisa del Giocondo, but some people also call her La Gioconda, which means "the happy one" in Italian. She was from a noble family in Florence and Tuscany.
        Leonardo painted Lisa with a mysterious smile that has fascinated people for centuries. He used a technique called sfumato, which means "smoky" in Italian, to create a soft and realistic effect. He also made the background look like a dreamy landscape with mountains and rivers. Some people think that the painting is not just a portrait, but also a symbol of Leonardo's ideas about nature, science, and art.
        The painting became very famous after it was stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911 by an Italian patriot named Vincenzo Peruggia.<br> He wanted to return it to Italy, where he thought it belonged. He was caught two years later when he tried to sell it to an art dealer in Florence. The painting was returned to the Louvre, where it has been on display ever since. It is now one of the most visited, written about, and parodied works of art in the world.
        The Mona Lisa is also very valuable. It was insured for $100 million in 1962, which is equivalent to $1 billion today. It is now the property of the French Republic and is protected by bulletproof glass and security guards. It is considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Renaissance and a symbol of Western culture.
        <br><br>Fun fact: if you stand within a distance less than 10 meters and start to walk sideways while staring at the paintings eyes it will give you the illusion the eyes of the painting are moving with you.
