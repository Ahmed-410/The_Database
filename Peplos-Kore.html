        The statue was made from limestone and stands at 165 cm tall. An inscription on the base indicates that the statue was dedicated to the goddess of wisdom, Athena by a person identified as Rhombas. 
        It has been suggested that the statue was made in the likeness of the patron who commissioned it and was most likely a prominent figure in the Attican region.
