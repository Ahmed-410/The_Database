        After Adam West, Michael Keaton was cast as Batman, and people, after getting the news, were highly skeptical. Since Keaton was known for his comic roles, people thought that Batman was going to be a goofball again but once the movie was released, Keatonâ€™s Batman threw a Batarang at all the skepticism floating around.
        Batman 1989 is said to be one of the best Batman movies ever made, as Keaton was able to perfectly pull off the role of the dark and broody Batman alongside the role of the soft and charming Bruce Wayne. This movie gives us an insight into why Wayne became Batman and all his traumas as well.
        This movie not only brought us an almost perfect Batman but also an equally terrific performance of Jack Nicholas as the Joker. His performance was scary as well as entertaining to watch, giving people an amazing battle between the legendary, timeless enemies, Batman and The Joker.
