        Batman Returns is the second installment of Michael Keatonâ€™s Batman movies and features Catwoman played by Michelle Pfeiffer. This movie has the scariest and ghore-filled presentation of the penguin, played by Danny DeVito, ever seen in a live-action Batman movie. It was also the last movie where Michael Keaton appeared as the Batman, marking the end of one of the most amazing Batman series ever seen on screen.       </P>
