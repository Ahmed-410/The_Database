        The painting known as Girl with a Pearl Earring is an oil painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, dated around 1665.
        It shows a young woman wearing an oriental turban and a large pearl earring. The painting is not a portrait,
        but a tronie, which means a head that was not meant to represent a specific person, but a type or character.
        The identity of the girl is unknown, and there are different theories about who she was or what she symbolized.
        Some have suggested that she was Vermeer's daughter, Maria, or that she was a biblical figure, such as Esther or Ruth. 
        The painting is famous for its subtle use of light and color, and the mysterious expression of the girl, who seems to be looking at the viewer with curiosity or invitation.
        The painting has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague since 1902, and has been the subject of various literary and cinematic adaptations.
