        After the massive failure of the former Batman movies, Christopher Nolan came up as a savior for the legacy of Batman. In the year 2005, Batman Begins was released, and it completely redefined the superhero movie genre for years to come. Christan Bale was cast to play the role of Batman, and he did a phenomenal job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Nolanâ€™s movies were not just superhero movies but told us the tale of a man who had lost everything he cared about and was willing to lose whatever was left for the greater good.
        This movie not only explored the dark broody Batman but also gave us an insight into the deeply traumatized Bruce Wayne and the way it has been done is simply beautiful
