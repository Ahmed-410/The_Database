        Today there are many Roman copies that remain of the original bronze statue of Discobulus. The statue, also known as the Discus Thrower, is believed to have been sculpted by Myron of Eleutherae. Eleutherae was a famous sculptor from Athens known for his bronze representations of athletes. Created around 460 BCE, there have been many reproductions of the famous discus thrower. The first sculpture was unearthed at the property of the Massino family in 1781. Made in the first century, the Palombara Discobolus was discovered at the Villa Palombara, which was situated on Esquiline Hill. The sculpture was then sent by train to Germany, where it was displayed at the Glyptothek in Munich. In 1948 the sculpture was returned to Italy where it has been on display ever since at the National Museum of Rome. Another copy was found in 1770 at Hadrienâ€™s wall, which was purchased by Thomas Jenkins, an English art dealer in an auction in 1792. In 1805, it was bought by Charles Townly for the British Museum for four hundred pounds sterling.     </P>
