        Whistler's Mother painting by James McNeill Whistler. It's a famous oil painting that he made in 1871 in London, where he lived with his mom, Anna McNeill Whistler. 
        She was his model for the painting, because the original one couldn't show up. He wanted to paint her standing, but she got tired, so he made her sit on a chair instead. 
        The painting is also called Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1, because he focused on the colors and shapes, not just the portrait. He had to add the subtitle Portrait of the Painter's Mother to get it accepted by the Royal Academy of Art, 
        because they didn't like his style. The painting is now in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, and it's one of the most famous American artworks in the world. Some people call it the American Mona Lisa or an icon of motherhood. 
        He also painted another one like it, with Thomas Carlyle as the model, called Arrangement in Grey and Black.
