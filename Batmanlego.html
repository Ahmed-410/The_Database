        The Lego Batman movie was undoubtedly one of the best Batman movies ever made. It was a perfect mix of comedy, a parody of previous Batman projects as well as having a story of its own. We see the character of Batman go through a complete emotional journey from living in self-induced denial to facing his fears and becoming a better person. This movie has no links to upcoming or previous Batman films but is still always a delight to watch no matter how many times you do.    </div>
