        The iconic 1966 adaptation of Batman by Adam West was the first ever colorized Batman movie and remains a timeless classic to date. 
        But, this movie was not exactly like the Batman movies we have now since this movie removed the “dark” out of the Dark Knight and turned him into an absolute goofball cracking jokes and doing funny things on screen. 
        This movie completely ignored the dark side of the character and made it all about laughs and gags.
        Even though totally astray from what Batman is about, being the first ever full-fledged, color Batman movie, this movie did become a fan favorite and Adam West, 
        because of his goofy adaptation of Batman, got the title of the “Black Sheep” down the lane
