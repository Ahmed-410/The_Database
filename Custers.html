        The painting "Custer's Last Fight" depicts the battle of Little Bighorn, where General George Armstrong Custer and his troops were defeated by a coalition of Native American warriors in 1876. The painting was based on the account of a scout named Curley, who survived the battle and witnessed Custer's last stand. The painting was created by Cassilly Adams, an artist who specialized in Western scenes, in 1888. He sold it to John Ferber, a saloon owner in St. Louis, Missouri, who displayed it in his establishment.
        In 1892, Adolphus Busch, the founder of Anheuser-Busch Brewing Company, acquired the painting along with the saloon. He saw the potential of using the painting as a promotional tool for his beer brand, Budweiser. He hired the Milwaukee Lithographic & Engraving Company to make a copy of the painting and produce chromolithographs, which are color prints made from multiple stone plates. The artist who made the copy was Otto F. Becker, who added some details to the original painting, such as Custer's medals and banners in the lower left margin and a mounted Indian beside a monument in the lower right margin.
        The chromolithographs were distributed to saloons and dining establishments across the country as a form of advertising for Budweiser. The prints were very popular and widely reproduced, with over 150,000 copies made by 1896. There have been 18 subsequent editions since then, totaling over 1 million copies according to Anheuser-Busch. The chromolithographs are considered one of the most iconic images of the American West and have influenced many other representations of Custer's Last Fight in movies, books and comics.
        The original painting by Adams was destroyed by fire in 1946. The copy by Becker is still owned by Anheuser-Busch and hangs in their board room in St. Louis. The chromolithographs are part of many museum collections, such as the National Museum of American History and the Amon Carter Museum of American Art.
