        The latest Batman movie came out in 2022 as “The Batman,” where Robert Pattinson took up the role of the Dark Knight. Trust me when I say this, if you really wish to know how Batman would be if he jumped straight out of a comic book into the real world, this movie is your answer.
        Although this version of Batman lacks in the true portrayal of Bruce Wayne to an extent, it portrays a perfect Batman, who is more of a detective. He is dark, gritty, scary, and a literal embodiment of fear. The picturization of this movie, the use of lights, shadows, darkness, and the background music make this movie a complete experience in itself.
