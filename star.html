        It's a famous artwork by Vincent van Gogh, a Dutch painter who lived in the 19th century.
         He made it in June 1889, when he was staying in an asylum in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, France.
          He was suffering from mental illness and he painted the view from his window, but he added some imaginary elements, like the village and the swirling stars. 
          He used oil on canvas and he created a lot of contrast and movement with his brushstrokes. 
          The painting is now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and it's one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art. 
        <br><br>Fun fact: This painting used to be taught to young students in stirling primary school.
