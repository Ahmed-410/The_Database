        This terracotta Greek sculpture is from the late Archaic period and depicts Zeus carrying Ganymede to Mount Olympus. It was originally used as an acroterion for one of the Olympian treasuries and is nearly life-sized, which was unusual considering the medium. The sculpture has since been attributed to a Corinthian workshop and was created in the period of transition between the Archaic and Classical eras.
        More fragments were discovered at the same site during various excavations until 1938. The sculpture is far from complete but has been reconstructed in its best form using its many fragments. Today, the sculpture can be found at the Olympia Archeological Museum, as the earliest example of Greek art in which the subjectâ€™s eyes do not simply stare forward, but was executed in an expressive and realistic manner.
