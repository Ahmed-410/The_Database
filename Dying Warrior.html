        Built as a dedication to the goddess Aphaia, the temple of Aphaia was situated on the island of Aegina within a sanctuary. The current temple was built on the site of two previous temples that had been destroyed through the ages. Ancient Greek statues were removed from the western and eastern pediments of the temple and were shipped overseas. Once there, they were sold to Ludwig I of Hanover. The Greek sculpture is thought to portray Laomedon, a fallen Trojan hero. It was seen as an honor to die in such a way, and Greek sculptors depicted these men as courageous heroes. Even though the back parts of the marble statues were not visible to the human eye, they had been just as exquisitely polished as the rest of the sculpture, as nothing escaped the eyes of the gods. This beautifully crafted sculpture was part of a series from the Archaic period that would end up in the Glyptothek in Munich. 
        They have since been shown to have had a significant influence on the architecture and art of Munich.    </P>
