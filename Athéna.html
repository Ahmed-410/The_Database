        This ancient Greek sculpture depicted the Greek goddess Athena and was sculpted from ivory and gold by Phidias. Athena Parthenos was originally located in the Parthenon in Athens as the focal point of the Parthenon, and although greatly admired in its time, it has since been lost to history. 
        Many replicas have been created since then, as well as other works that were inspired by the description of this statue of Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom. The sculpture experienced a series of events that would cause great damage to the statue, 
        including an instance when the tyrant Lachares took the sheets of gold off the sculpture to pay his soldiers in 296 BCE. 
        It was further damaged in 165 BCE in a huge fire but was later repaired. There were accounts of its appearance in the 10th century in Constantinople. 
        Today, there are ancient replicas that can be viewed, including the 3rd-century Varvakeion Athena, which is housed in the National Archeological Museum of Athens.
