        American Gothic is a famous painting by Grant Wood that shows a farmer and his daughter standing in front of a house with a Gothic window. 
        The painting was made in 1930 and is now in the Art Institute of Chicago. Wood was inspired by a real house he saw in Eldon, Iowa, and he imagined the kind of people who would live there. 
        He used his sister Nan and his dentist Dr. McKeeby as models for the painting, but they never posed together. The painting is a word play on the architectural style of the house, 
        which is called Carpenter Gothic. The painting is also a symbol of the American Midwest and its values of hard work, honesty and simplicity. Some people see the painting as a satire of rural life, while others see it as a tribute to American spirit. The painting has been widely parodied and copied in popular culture, 
        and it is one of the most recognizable images of American art.
