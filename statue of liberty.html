        The Statue of Liberty is a huge sculpture that stands on Liberty Island in New York Harbor. It was a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States to celebrate their friendship and the ideals of freedom and democracy. The statue was designed by French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi and built with the help of engineer Gustave Eiffel, who also created the Eiffel Tower. The statue was made of copper sheets over an iron framework. It took 10 years to complete and was finished in 1884 in France. It was then taken apart and shipped to New York in 1885, where it was reassembled on a granite pedestal on Liberty Island. The statue was officially dedicated on October 28, 1886 by President Grover Cleveland. The statue depicts a woman holding a torch in her right hand and a tablet in her left hand. The tablet has the date of the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776, written in Roman numerals. The woman wears a crown with seven spikes that represent the seven continents and the seven seas. The statue is also known as Liberty Enlightening the World, which is its official name. The statue has become a symbol of freedom, hope, and immigration for millions of people who have come to America seeking a better life.
