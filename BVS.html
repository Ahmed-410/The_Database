    <P> 
        After 2012, Batman made a comeback to the big screen with Batman vs. Superman (2016), but Ben Affleck took up the mantle of Batman this time. And even after a lot of skepticism, Ben Affleck turned out to be one of the most comic-accurate Batman ever seen on screen. He played the role of the charismatic Bruce Wayne as well as the dark and gritty Batman with utmost comic accuracy.
        This movie showed us how Batman sees Superman as a potential threat since he is too powerful. We see an epic battle between Superman and Batman where Batman absolutely destroys Superman. We also see Doomsday appear on screen for the first time in this movie.
